  <p class="drop-cap">AT a time when the general rights and liberties of mankind, and the
    preservation of those valuable privileges transmitted to us from our
    ancestors, are become so much the subjects of universal consideration;
    can it be an inquiry indifferent to any, how many of those who
    distinguish themselves as the Advocates of Liberty, remain insensible
    and inattentive to the treatment of thousands and tens of thousands of
    our fellow men, who, from motives of avarice, and the inexorable decree
    of tyrant custom, are at this very time kept in the most deplorable
    state of Slavery, in many parts of the <i>British</i> Dominions?</p>

  <p>The intent of publishing the following sheets, is more fully to
    make known the aggravated iniquity attending the practice of the
    Slave-Trade; whereby many thousands of our fellow-creatures, as free
    as ourselves by nature, and equally with us the subjects of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span> Christ’s
    redeeming Grace, are yearly brought into inextricable and barbarous
    bondage; and many, very many, to miserable and untimely ends.</p>

  <p>The Truth of this lamentable Complaint is so obvious to persons of
    candour, under whose notice it hath fallen, that several have lately
    published their sentiments thereon, as a matter which calls for the
    most serious consideration of all who are concerned for the civil or
    religious welfare of their Country. How an evil of so deep a dye, hath
    so long, not only passed uninterrupted by those in Power, but hath
    even had their Countenance, is indeed surprising; and charity would
    suppose, must in a great measure have arisen from this, that many
    persons in government, both of the Clergy and Laity, in whose power it
    hath been to put a stop to the Trade, have been unacquainted with the
    corrupt motives which gives life to it, and with the groans, the dying
    groans, which daily ascend to God, the common Father of mankind, from
    the broken hearts of those his deeply oppressed creatures: otherwise
    the powers of the earth would not, I think I may venture to say could
    not, have so long authorized a practice so inconsistent with every
    idea of liberty and justice, which, as the learned <i>James Foster</i>
    says, <i>Bids that God, which is the God and Father of the</i>
    Gentiles, <i>unconverted to</i> Christianity, <i>most daring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span> and bold
    defiance; and spurns at all the principles both of natural and revealed
    Religion</i>.</p>

  <p>Much might justly be said of the temporal evils which attend this
    practice, as it is destructive of the welfare of human society, and
    of the peace and prosperity of every country, in proportion as it
    prevails. It might be also shewn, that it destroys the bonds of natural
    affection and interest, whereby mankind in general are united; that it
    introduces idleness, discourages marriage, corrupts the youth, ruins
    and debauches morals, excites continual apprehensions of dangers, and
    frequent alarms, to which the Whites are necessarily exposed from so
    great an increase of a People, that, by their Bondage and Oppressions,
    become natural enemies, yet, at the same time, are filling the places
    and eating the bread of those who would be the Support and Security
    of the Country. But as these and many more reflections of the same
    kind, may occur to a considerate mind, I shall only endeavour to shew,
    from the nature of the Trade, the plenty which <i>Guinea</i> affords
    to its inhabitants, the barbarous Treatment of the Negroes, and the
    Observations made thereon by Authors of note, that it is inconsistent
    with the plainest Precepts of the Gospel, the dictates of reason, and
    every common sentiment of humanity.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

  <p>In an Account of the <i>European</i> Settlements in <i>America</i>,
    printed in <i>London</i>, 1757, the Author, speaking on this Subject,
    says: ‘The Negroes in our Colonies endure a Slavery more complete, and
    attended with far worse circumstances than what any people in their
    condition suffer in any other part of the world, or have suffered
    in any other period of time: Proofs of this are not wanting. The
    prodigious waste which we experience in this unhappy part of our
    Species, is a full and melancholy Evidence of this Truth. The Island
    of <i>Barbadoes</i> (the Negroes upon which do not amount to eighty
    thousand) notwithstanding all the means which they use to encrease them
    by Propagation, and that the Climate is in every respect (except that
    of being more wholesome) exactly resembling the Climate from whence
    they come; notwithstanding all this, <i>Barbadoes</i> lies under a
    necessity of an annual recruit of five thousand slaves, to keep up
    the stock at the number I have mentioned. This prodigious failure,
    which is at least in the same proportion in all our Islands, shews
    demonstratively that some uncommon and unsupportable Hardship lies
    upon the Negroes, which wears them down in such a surprising manner;
    and this, I imagine, is principally the excessive labour which they
    undergo.’ In an Account of part of <i>North-America</i>, published by
    <i>Thomas Jeffery</i>, printed 1761,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span> speaking of the usage the Negroes
    receive in the <i>West-India</i> Islands, he thus expresses himself:
    ‘It is impossible for a human heart to reflect upon the servitude of
    these dregs of mankind, without in some measure feeling for their
    misery, which ends but with their lives.——Nothing can be more wretched
    than the condition of this People. One would imagine, they were framed
    to be the disgrace of the human species: banished from their Country,
    and deprived of that blessing, Liberty, on which all other nations
    set the greatest value, they are in a manner reduced to the condition
    of beasts of burden. In general a few roots, potatoes especially, are
    their food; and two rags, which neither screen them from the heat
    of the day, nor the extraordinary coolness of the night, all their
    covering; their sleep very short; their labour almost continual; they
    receive no wages, but have twenty lashes for the smallest fault.’</p>

  <p>A considerate young person, who was lately in one of our
    <i>West-India</i> Islands, where he observed the miserable situation
    of the Negroes, makes the following remarks: ‘I meet with daily
    exercise, to see the treatment which these miserable wretches meet
    with from their masters, with but few exceptions. They whip them most
    unmercifully, on small occasions; they beat them with thick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span> Clubs,
    and you will see their Bodies all whaled and scarred: in short, they
    seem to set no other value on their lives than as they cost them so
    much money; and are not retrained from killing them, when angry, by
    a worthier consideration than that they lose so much. They act as
    though they did not look upon them as a race of human creatures, who
    have reason, and remembrance of misfortunes; but as beasts, like oxen,
    who are stubborn, hardy and senseless, fit for burdens, and designed
    to bear them. They will not allow them to have any claim to human
    privileges, or scarce, indeed, to be regarded as the work of God.
    Though it was consistent with the justice of our Maker to pronounce
    the sentence on our common parent, and through him on all succeeding
    generations, <i>That he and they should eat their bread by the sweat
      of their brow</i>; yet does it not stand recorded by the same Eternal
    Truth, <i>That the Labourer is worthy of his Hire</i>? It cannot be
    allowed in natural justice, that there should be a servitude without
    condition: A cruel endless servitude. It cannot be reconcileable to
    natural justice, that whole nations, nay, whole continents of men,
    should be devoted to do the drudgery of life for others, be dragged
    away from their attachments of relations and societies, and made to
    serve the appetites and pleasures of a race of men, whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span> superiority
    has been obtained by an illegal force.’</p>

  <p>A particular account of the treatment these unhappy <i>Africans</i>
    receive in the <i>West-Indies</i> was lately published, which, even
    by those who, blinded by interest, seek excuses for the Trade, and
    endeavour to palliate the cruelty exercised upon them, is allowed to
    be a true, though rather too favourable representation of the usage
    they receive, which is as follows, <i>viz.</i> ‘The iniquity of the
    Slave-trade is greatly aggravated by the inhumanity with which the
    Negroes are treated in the Plantations, as well with respect to food
    and clothing, as from the unreasonable labour which is commonly
    exacted from them. To which may be added the cruel chastisements
    they frequently suffer, without any other bounds than the will and
    wrath of their hard task-masters. In <i>Barbadoes</i>, and some other
    of the Islands, six pints of <i>Indian</i> corn and three herrings
    are reckoned a full weeks allowance for a working slave, and in the
    System of Geography it is said, <i>That in</i> Jamaica <i>the owners
    of the Negroe-slaves, set aside for each a parcel of ground, and
    allow them</i> Sundays <i>to manure it, the produce of which</i>,
    with sometimes a few herrings, or other salt-fish, <i>is all that is
    allowed for their support</i>. Their allowance for clothing in the
    Islands is seldom more than six yards of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span> osenbrigs each year: And
    in the more northern Colonies, where the piercing westerly winds are
    long and sensibly felt, these poor <i>Africans</i> suffer much for
    want of sufficient clothing, indeed some have none till they are able
    to pay for it by their labour. The time that the Negroes work in the
    <i>West-Indies</i>, is from day-break till noon; then again from two
    o’clock till dusk: (during which time they are attended by overseers,
    who severely scourge those who appear to them dilatory) and before
    they are suffered to go to their quarters, they have still something
    to do, as collecting of herbage for the horses, gathering fuel for
    the boilers, <i>etc.</i> so that it is often half past twelve before
    they can get home, when they have scarce time to grind and boil their
    <i>Indian</i> corn; whereby it often happens that they are called again
    to labour before they can satisfy their Hunger. And here no delay or
    excuse will avail, for if they are not in the Field immediately upon
    the usual notice, they must expect to feel the Overseer’s Lash. In
    crop-time (which lasts many months) they are obliged (by turns) to
    work most of the night in the boiling-house. Thus their Owners, from a
    desire of making the greatest gain by the labour of their slaves, lay
    heavy Burdens on them, and yet feed and clothe them very sparingly, and
    some scarce feed or clothe them at all, so that the poor creatures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span> are
    obliged to shift for their living in the best manner they can, which
    occasions their being often killed in the neighbouring lands, stealing
    potatoes, or other food, to satisfy their hunger. And if they take any
    thing from the plantation they belong to, though under such pressing
    want, their owners will correct them severely, for taking a little of
    what they have so hardly laboured for, whilst they themselves riot in
    the greatest luxury and excess.—It is a matter of astonishment, how
    a people, who, as a nation, are looked upon as generous and humane,
    and so much value themselves for their uncommon sense of the Benefit
    of Liberty, can live in the practice of such extreme oppression and
    inhumanity, without seeing the inconsistency of such conduct, and
    without feeling great Remorse: Nor is it less amazing to hear these
    men calmly making calculations about the strength and lives of their
    fellow-men; in <i>Jamaica</i>, if six in ten, of the new imported
    Negroes survive the seasoning, it is looked upon as a gaining purchase:
    And in most of the other plantations, if the Negroes live eight or
    nine years, their labour is reckoned a sufficient compensation for
    their cost.——If calculations of this sort were made upon the strength
    and labour of beasts of burden, it would not appear so strange; but
    even then a merciful man would certainly use his beast with more mercy
    than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span> is usually shewn to the poor Negroes.—Will not the groans of this
    deeply afflicted and oppressed people reach Heaven, and when the cup of
    iniquity is full, must not the inevitable consequence be pouring forth
    of the judgments of God upon their oppressors. But, alas! is it not too
    manifest that this oppression has already long been the object of the
    divine displeasure; for what heavier judgment, what greater calamity
    can befall any people, than to become a prey to that hardness of
    heart, that forgetfulness of God, and insensibility to every religious
    impression; as well as that general depravation of manners, which so
    much prevails in the Colonies, in proportion as they have more or less
    enriched themselves, at the expence of the blood and bondage of the
    Negroes.’</p>

  <p>The situation of the Negroes in our Southern provinces on the
    Continent, is also feelingly set forth by <i>George Whitfield</i>, in
    a Letter from <i>Georgia</i>, to the Inhabitants of <i>Maryland</i>,
    <i>Virginia</i>, <i>North</i> and <i>South-Carolina</i>, printed in the
    Year 1739, of which the following is an extract: ‘As I lately passed
    through your provinces, in my way hither, I was sensibly touched with
    a fellow-feeling of the miseries of the poor Negroes. Whether it be
    lawful for <i>Christians</i> to buy slaves, and thereby encourage the
    Nations from whom they are bought, to be at perpetual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span> war with each
    other, I shall not take upon me to determine; sure I am, it is sinful,
    when bought, to use them as bad, nay worse than as though they were
    brutes; and whatever particular exception there may be, (as I would
    charitably hope there are some) I fear the generality of you, that
    own Negroes, are liable to such a charge; for your slaves, I believe,
    work as hard, if not harder, than the horses whereon you ride. These,
    after they have done their work, are fed and taken proper care of;
    but many Negroes, when wearied with labour, in your plantations, have
    been obliged to grind their own corn, after they return home. Your
    dogs are caressed and fondled at your table; but your slaves, who are
    frequently stiled dogs or beasts, have not an equal privilege; they are
    scarce permitted to pick up the crumbs which fall from their master’s
    table.—Not to mention what numbers have been given up to the inhuman
    usage of cruel task-masters, who, by their unrelenting scourges, have
    ploughed their backs, and made long furrows, and at length brought
    them even to death. When passing along, I have viewed your plantations
    cleared and cultivated, many spacious houses built, and the owners
    of them faring sumptuously every day, my blood has frequently almost
    run cold within me, to consider how many of your slaves had neither
    convenient food to eat, or proper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span> raiment to put on, notwithstanding
    most of the comforts you enjoy were solely owing to their indefatigable
    labours.—The Scripture says, <i>Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that
    treadeth out the corn</i>. Does God take care for oxen? and will he
    not take care of the Negroes also? undoubtedly he will.—Go to now ye
    rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you:
    Behold the provision of the poor Negroes, who have reaped down your
    fields, which is by you denied them, crieth; and the cries of them
    which reaped, are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabbath. We
    have a remarkable instance of God’s taking cognizance of, and avenging
    the quarrel of poor slaves, 2 Sam. xxi. 1. <i>There was a famine in
    the days of</i> David <i>three years, year after year; and</i> David
    <i>enquired of the Lord: And the Lord answered, It is for</i> Saul,
    <i>and for his bloody house, because he slew the</i> Gibeonites. Two
    things are here very remarkable: First, These <i>Gibeonites</i> were
    only hewers of wood and drawers of water, or in other words, slaves
    like yours. Secondly, That this plague was sent by God many years
    after the injury, the cause of the plague, was committed. And for what
    end were this and such like examples recorded in holy Scriptures?
    without doubt, for our learning.—For God is the same to-day as he was
    yesterday, and will continue the same for ever. He does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span> reject the
    prayer of the poor and destitute; nor disregard the cry of the meanest
    Negro. The blood of them spilt for these many years in your respective
    provinces will ascend up to heaven against you.’</p>

  <p>Some who have only seen Negroes in an abject state of slavery,
    broken-spirited and dejected, knowing nothing of their situation
    in their native country, may apprehend, that they are naturally
    insensible of the benefits of Liberty, being destitute and miserable
    in every respect, and that our suffering them to live amongst us
    (as the <i>Gibeonites</i> of old were permitted to live with the
    <i>Israelites</i>) though even on more oppressive terms, is to them a
    favour; but these are certainly erroneous opinions, with respect to
    far the greatest part of them: Although it is highly probable that
    in a country which is more than three thousand miles in extent from
    north to south, and as much from east to west, there will be barren
    parts, and many inhabitants more uncivilized and barbarous than others;
    as is the case in all other countries: yet, from the most authentic
    accounts, the inhabitants of <i>Guinea</i> appear, generally speaking,
    to be an industrious, humane, sociable people, whose capacities are
    naturally as enlarged, and as open to improvement, as those of the
    <i>Europeans</i>; and that their Country is fruitful, and in many
    places well improved, abounding in cattle, grain and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span> fruits. And as
    the earth yields all the year round a fresh supply of food, and but
    little clothing is requisite, by reason of the continual warmth of the
    climate; the necessaries of life are much easier procured in most parts
    of <i>Africa</i>, than in our more northern climes. This is confirmed
    by many authors of note, who have resided there; among others, <i>M.
    Adanson</i>, in his account of <i>Goree</i> and <i>Senegal</i>, in the
    year 1754, says, ‘Which way soever I turned my eyes on this pleasant
    spot, I beheld a perfect image of pure nature; an agreeable solitude,
    bounded on every side by charming landscapes, the rural situation of
    cottages in the midst of trees; the ease and indolence of the Negroes
    reclined under the shade of their spreading foliage; the simplicity of
    their dress and manners; the whole revived in my mind the idea of our
    first parents, and I seemed to contemplate the world in its primitive
    state: They are, generally speaking, very good-natured, sociable and
    obliging. I was not a little pleased with this my first reception; it
    convinced me, that there ought to be a considerable abatement made in
    the accounts I had read and heard every where of the savage character
    of the <i>Africans</i>. I observed, both in Negroes and Moors, great
    humanity and sociableness, which gave me strong hopes, that I should
    be very safe amongst them, and meet with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span> the success I desired, in my
    inquiries after the curiosities of the country.’</p>

  <p><i>William Bosman</i>, a principal Factor for the <i>Dutch</i>, who
    resided sixteen years in <i>Guinea</i>, speaking of the natives of
    that part where he then was, says, ‘They are generally a good sort
    of people, honest in their dealings;’ others he describes as ‘being
    generally friendly to strangers, of a mild conversation, affable,
    and easy to be overcome with reason.’ He adds, ‘That some Negroes,
    who have had an agreeable education, have manifested a brightness of
    understanding equal to any of us.’ Speaking of the fruitfulness of the
    country, he says, ‘It was very populous, plentifully provided with
    corn, potatoes and fruit, which grew close to each other; in some
    places a foot-path is the only ground that is not covered with them;
    the Negroes leaving no place, which is thought fertile, uncultivated;
    and immediately after they have reaped, they are sure to sow again.’
    Other parts he describes, as ‘being full of towns and villages; the
    soil very rich, and so well cultivated, as to look like an entire
    garden, abounding in rice, corn, oxen, and poultry, and the inhabitants
    laborious.’</p>

  <p><i>William Smith</i>, who was sent by the <i>African</i> Company to
    visit their settlements on the coast of <i>Guinea</i>, in the year
    1726, gives much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span> the same account of the country of <i>Delmina</i>
    and <i>Cape Corse</i>, &amp;c. for beauty and goodness, and adds, ‘The
    more you come downward towards that part, called <i>Slave-Coast</i>,
    the more delightful and rich the soil appears.’ Speaking of their
    disposition, he says, ‘They were a civil, good-natured people,
    industrious to the last degree. It is easy to perceive what happy
    memories they are blessed with, and how great progress they would make
    in the sciences, in case their genius was cultivated with study.’ He
    adds, from the information he received of one of the Factors, who had
    resided ten years in that country, ‘That the discerning natives account
    it their greatest unhappiness, that they were ever visited by the
    <i>Europeans</i>.—That the <i>Christians</i> introduced the traffick of
    Slaves; and that before our coming they lived in peace.’</p>

  <p><i>Andrew Brue</i>, a principal man in the <i>French</i> Factory, in
    the account he gives of the great river <i>Senegal</i>, which runs
    many hundred miles up the country, tells his readers, ‘The farther
    you go from the Sea, the country on the river seems more fruitful and
    well improved. It abounds in <i>Guinea</i> and <i>Indian</i> corn,
    rice, pulse, tobacco, and indigo. Here are vast meadows, which feed
    large herds of great and small cattle; poultry are numerous, as well
    as wild fowl.’ The same Author, in his travels to the south of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
    river <i>Gambia</i>, expresses his surprize, ‘to see the land so well
    cultivated; scarce a spot lay unimproved; the low grounds, divided
    by small canals, were all sowed with rice; the higher ground planted
    with <i>Indian</i> corn, millet, and peas of different sorts: beef
    and mutton very cheap, as well as all other necessaries of life.’
    The account this Author gives of the disposition of the natives, is,
    ‘That they are generally good-natured and civil, and may be brought
    to any thing by fair and soft means.’ <i>Artus</i>, speaking of the
    same people, says, ‘They are a sincere, inoffensive people, and do no
    injustice either to one another or strangers.’</p>

  <p>From these Accounts, both of the good Disposition of the Natives, and
    the Fruitfulness of most parts of <i>Guinea</i>, which are confirmed by
    many other Authors, it may well be concluded, that their acquaintance
    with the <i>Europeans</i> would have been a happiness to them, had
    those last not only borne the name, but indeed been influenced by the
    Spirit of <i>Christianity</i>; but, alas! how hath the Conduct of
    the Whites contradicted the Precepts and Example of Christ? Instead
    of promoting the End of his Coming, by preaching the Gospel of Peace
    and Good-will to Man, they have, by their practices, contributed to
    enflame every noxious passion of corrupt nature in the Negroes; they
    have incited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span> them to make war one upon another, and for this purpose
    have furnished them with prodigious quantities of ammunition and arms,
    whereby they have been hurried into confusion, bloodshed, and all the
    extremities of temporal misery, which must necessarily beget in their
    minds such a general detestation and scorn of the <i>Christian</i>
    name, as may deeply affect, if not wholly preclude, their belief of the
    great Truths of our holy Religion. Thus an insatiable desire of gain
    hath become the principal and moving cause of the most abominable and
    dreadful scene, that was perhaps ever acted upon the face of the earth;
    even the power of their Kings hath been made subservient to answer
    this wicked purpose, instead of being Protectors of their people,
    these Rulers, allured by the tempting bait laid before them by the
    <i>European</i> Factors, <i>&amp;c.</i> have invaded the Liberties of their
    unhappy subjects, and are become their Oppressors.</p>

  <p>Divers accounts have already appeared in print, declarative of the
    shocking wickedness with which this Trade is carried on; these may not
    have fallen into the hands of some of my readers, I shall, therefore,
    for their information, select a few of the most remarkable instances
    that I have met with, shewing the method by which the Trade is commonly
    managed all along the <i>African</i> coast.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

  <p><i>Francis Moor</i>, Factor to the <i>African</i> Company, on the river
    <i>Gambia</i>, relates, ‘That when the King of <i>Barsalli</i> wants
    goods, <i>&amp;c.</i> he sends a messenger to the <i>English</i> Governor
    at <i>James</i>’s Fort, to desire he would send up a sloop with a
    cargo of goods; which (says the author) the Governor never fails to
    do: Against the time the vessel arrives, the King plunders some of his
    enemies towns, selling the people for such goods as he wants.—If he is
    not at war with any neighbouring King, he falls upon one of his own
    towns, and makes bold to sell his own miserable subjects.’</p>

  <p><i>N. Brue</i>, in his account of the Trade, <i>&amp;c.</i> writes, ‘That
    having received a quantity of goods, he wrote to the King of the
    country, That if he had a sufficient number of slaves, he was ready
    to trade with him. This Prince (says that author) as well as other
    Negroe Monarchs, has always a sure way of supplying his deficiencies
    by selling his own subjects.—The King had recourse to this method, by
    seizing three hundred of his own people, and sent word to <i>Brue</i>,
    that he had the slaves ready to deliver for the goods.’</p>

  <p>The Misery and Bloodshed, consequent to the Slave-trade, is amply
    set forth by the following extracts of two voyages to the coast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span> of
    <i>Guinea</i> for slaves. The first in a vessel from <i>Liverpool</i>,
    taken <i>verbatim</i> from the original manuscript of the Surgeon’s
    journal, <i>viz.</i></p>

  <p>‘<span class="smcap">Sestro</span>, <i>December</i> the 29th, 1724. No trade to-day,
    though many Traders come on board; they inform us, that the people are
    gone to war within land, and will bring prisoners enough in two or
    three days: in hopes of which we stay.</p>

  <p>‘The 30th. No trade yet, but our Traders came on board to-day, and
    informed us, the people had burnt four towns of their enemies, so
    that to-morrow we expect slaves off. Another large ship is come in:
    Yesterday came in a large <i>Londoner</i>.</p>

  <p>‘The 31st. Fair weather, but no trade yet: We see each night towns
    burning; but we hear the <i>Sestro</i> men are many of them killed by
    the inland Negroes, so that we fear this war will be unsuccessful.</p>

  <p>‘The 2d <i>January</i>. Last night we saw a prodigious fire break out
    about eleven o’clock, and this morning see the town of <i>Sestro</i>
    burnt down to the ground, (it contained some hundreds of houses) so
    that we find their enemies are too hard for them at present, and
    consequently our trade spoiled here; so that about seven o’clock we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
    weighed anchor, as did likewise the three other vessels, to proceed
    lower down.’</p>

  <p>The second relation, also taken from the original manuscript journal of
    a person of credit, who went Surgeon on the same account in a vessel
    from <i>New-York</i> to the coast of <i>Guinea</i>, about nineteen
    years past, is as follows, <i>viz.</i></p>

  <p>‘Being on the coast at a place called <i>Basalia</i>, the Commander
    of the vessel, according to custom, sent a person on shore with a
    present to the King, acquainting him with his arrival, and letting
    him know, they wanted a cargo of slaves. The King promised to furnish
    them with slaves; and in order to do it, set out to go to war against
    his enemies, designing also to surprize some town, and take all the
    people prisoners: Some time after, the King sent them word, he had
    not yet met with the desired success, having been twice repulsed, in
    attempting to break up two towns; but that he still hoped to procure
    a number of slaves for them; and in this design he persisted till he
    met his enemies in the field, where a battle was fought, which lasted
    three days; during which time the engagement was so bloody, that four
    thousand five hundred men were slain on the spot.’ The person, that
    wrote the account, beheld the bodies as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span> they lay on the field of
    battle. ‘Think (says he in his journal) what a pitiable sight it was,
    to see the widows weeping over their lost husbands, orphans deploring
    the loss of their fathers, <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>&amp;c.</i>’</p>

  <p>Those who are acquainted with the Trade agree, that many Negroes on the
    sea-coast, who have been corrupted by their intercourse and converse
    with the <i>European</i> Factors, have learnt to stick at no act of
    cruelty for gain. These make it a practice to steal abundance of little
    Blacks of both sexes, when found on the roads or in the fields, where
    their parents keep them all day to watch the corn, <i>&amp;c.</i> Some
    authors say, the Negroe Factors go six or seven hundred miles up the
    country with goods, bought from the <i>Europeans</i>, where markets of
    men are kept in the same manner as those of beasts with us. When the
    poor slaves, whether brought from far or near, come to the sea-shore,
    they are stripped naked, and strictly examined by the <i>European</i>
    Surgeons, both men and women, without the least distinction or modesty;
    those which are approved as good, are marked with a red-hot iron with
    the ship’s mark; after which they are put on board the vessels, the
    men being shackled with irons two and two together. Reader, bring the
    matter home, and consider whether any situation in life can be more
    completely miserable than that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span> those distressed captives. When we
    reflect, that each individual of this number had some tender attachment
    which was broken by this cruel separation; some parent or wife, who
    had not an opportunity of mingling tears in a parting embrace; perhaps
    some infant or aged parent whom his labour was to feed and vigilance
    protect; themselves under the dreadful apprehension of an unknown
    perpetual slavery; pent up within the narrow confines of a vessel,
    sometimes six or seven hundred together, where they lie as close as
    possible. Under these complicated distresses they are often reduced to
    a state of desperation, wherein many have leaped into the sea, and have
    kept themselves under water till they were drowned; others have starved
    themselves to death, for the prevention whereof some masters of vessels
    have cut off the legs and arms of a number of those poor desperate
    creatures, to terrify the rest. Great numbers have also frequently been
    killed, and some deliberately put to death under the greatest torture,
    when they have attempted to rise, in order to free themselves from
    their present misery, and the slavery designed them. An instance of
    the last kind appears particularly in an account given by the master
    of a vessel, who brought a cargo of slaves to <i>Barbadoes</i>; indeed
    it appears so irreconcileable to the common dictates of humanity,
    that one would doubt the truth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span> of it, had it not been related by a
    serious person of undoubted credit, who had it from the captain’s own
    mouth. Upon an inquiry, What had been the success of his voyage? he
    answered, ‘That he had found it a difficult matter to set the negroes
    a fighting with each other, in order to procure the number he wanted;
    but that when he had obtained this end, and had got his vessel filled
    with slaves, a new difficulty arose from their refusal to take food;
    those desperate creatures chusing rather to die with hunger, than to
    be carried from their native country.’ Upon a farther inquiry, by what
    means he had prevailed upon them to forego this desperate resolution?
    he answered, ‘That he obliged all the negroes to come upon deck, where
    they persisted in their resolution of not taking food, he caused his
    sailors to lay hold upon one of the most obstinate, and chopt the poor
    creature into small pieces, forcing some of the others to eat a part
    of the mangled body; withal swearing to the survivors, that he would
    use them all, one after the other, in the same manner, if they did not
    consent to eat.’ This horrid execution he applauded as a good act, it
    having had the desired effect, in bringing them to take food.</p>

  <p>A similar case is mentioned in <i>Astley</i>’s Collection of Voyages,
    by <i>John Atkins</i>, Surgeon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span> on board Admiral <i>Ogle</i>’s
    squadron, ‘Of one <i>Harding</i>, mailer of a vessel, in which several
    of the men-slaves, and a woman-slave, had attempted to rise, in
    order to recover their liberty; some of whom the master, of his own
    authority, sentenced to cruel death; making them first eat the heart
    and liver of one of those he killed. The woman he hoisted by the
    thumbs; whipped and slashed with knives before the other slaves, till
    she died.’</p>

  <p>As detestable and shocking as this may appear to such, whose hearts
    are not yet hardened by the practice of that cruelty, which the love
    of wealth, by degrees, introduceth into the human mind; it will not
    be strange to those who have been concerned or employed in the Trade.
    Now here arises a necessary query to those who hold the balance and
    sword of justice; and who must account to God for the use they have
    made of it. <i>Since our English law is so truly valuable for its
    justice, how can they overlook these barbarous deaths of the unhappy
    Africans without trial, or due proof of their being guilty, of crimes
    adequate to their punishment? Why are those masters of vessels, (who
    are often not the most tender and considerate of men) thus suffered to
    be the sovereign arbiters of the lives of the miserable Negroes, and
    allowed, with impunity, thus to destroy, may I not say, murder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span> their
    fellow-creatures, and that by means so cruel as cannot be even related
    but with shame and horror?</i></p>

  <p>When the vessels arrive at their destined port in the Colonies, the
    poor Negroes are to be disposed of to the planters; and here they are
    again exposed naked, without any distinction of sexes, to the brutal
    examination of their purchasers; and this, it may well be judged is
    to many of them another occasion of deep distress, especially to
    the females. Add to this, that near connections must now again be
    separated, to go with their several purchasers: In this melancholy
    scene Mothers are seen hanging over their Daughters, be-dewing their
    naked breasts with tears, and Daughters clinging to their Parents; not
    knowing what new stage of distress must follow their separation, or if
    ever they shall meet again: And here what sympathy, what commiseration
    are they to expect? why indeed, if they will not separate as readily
    as their owners think proper, the whipper is called for, and the lash
    exercised upon their naked bodies, till obliged to part.</p>

  <p>Can any human heart, that retains a fellow-feeling for the Sufferings
    of mankind, be unconcerned at relations of such grievous affliction,
    to which this oppressed part of our Species are subjected: God gave to
    man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span> dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowls of the air,
    and over the cattle, <i>&amp;c.</i> but imposed no involuntary subjection
    of one man to another.</p>

  <p>The Truth of this Position has of late been clearly set forth by
    persons of reputation and ability, particularly <i>George Wallis</i>,
    in his System of the Laws of <i>Scotland</i>, whose sentiments are
    so worthy the notice of all considerate persons, that I shall here
    repeat a part of what he has not long since published, concerning the
    <i>African</i> Trade, <i>viz.</i> ‘If this Trade admits of a moral or
    a rational justification, every crime, even the most atrocious, may be
    justified: Government was instituted for the good of mankind. Kings,
    Princes, Governors, are not proprietors of those who are subjected
    to their authority, they have not a right to make them miserable. On
    the contrary, their authority is vested in them, that they may by the
    just exercise of it, promote the Happiness of their people: Of course,
    they have not a right to dispose of their Liberty, and to sell them
    for slaves: Besides, no man has a right to acquire or to purchase
    them; men and their Liberty, are not either saleable or purchaseable:
    One therefore has no body but himself to blame, in case he shall find
    himself deprived of a man, whom he thought he had, by buying for a
    price,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span> made his own; for he dealt in a Trade which was illicit, and
    was prohibited by the most obvious dictates of humanity. For these
    reasons, every one of those unfortunate men, who are pretended to be
    slaves, has a right to be declared free, for he never lost his Liberty,
    he could not lose it; his Prince had no power to dispose of him: of
    course the sale was void. This right he carries about with him, and
    is entitled every where to get it declared. As soon, therefore, as he
    comes into a country, in which the Judges are not forgetful of their
    own humanity, it is their duty to remember that he is a man, and to
    declare him to be free.—This is the Law of Nature, which is obligatory
    on all men, at all times, and in all places.—Would not any of us, who
    should be snatched by Pirates from his native land, think himself
    cruelly abused, and at all times intitled to be free? Have not these
    unfortunate <i>Africans</i>, who meet with the same cruel fate, the
    same right? are not they men as well as we? and have they not the same
    sensibility? Let us not, therefore, defend or support an usage, which
    is contrary to all the Laws of Humanity.’</p>

  <p><i>Francis Hutchinson</i>, also in his System of Moral Philosophy,
    speaking on the subject of Slavery, says, ‘He who detains another by
    force in slavery, is always bound to prove<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span> his title. The Slave sold
    or carried away into a distant country, must not be obliged to prove a
    negative, that he never forfeited his Liberty. The violent possessor
    must, in all cases, shew his title, especially where the old proprietor
    is well known. In this case each man is the original proprietor of his
    own Liberty: The proof of his losing it must be incumbent on those,
    who deprived him of it by force. Strange, (says the same author)
    that in any nation, where a sense of Liberty prevails, where the
    <i>Christian</i> religion is professed, custom and high prospect of
    gain can so stupify the consciences of men, and all sense of natural
    justice, that they can hear such computation made about the value of
    their fellow-men and their Liberty, without abhorrence and indignation.’</p>

  <p>The noted Baron <i>Montesquieu</i> gives it, as his opinion, in his
    <i>Spirit of Laws</i>, page 348, ‘That nothing more assimilates a man
    to a beast than living amongst freemen, himself a slave; such people as
    these are the natural enemies of society, and their number must always
    be dangerous.’</p>

  <p>The Author of a pamphlet, lately printed in <i>London</i>, entituled,
    <i>An Essay in Vindication of the continental Colonies of</i> America,
    writes, ‘That the bondage we have imposed on the <i>Africans</i>, is
    absolutely repugnant to justice.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span> That it is highly inconsistent with
    civil policy: First, as it tends to suppress all improvements in arts
    and sciences; without which it is morally impossible that any nation
    should be happy or powerful. Secondly, as it may deprave the minds of
    the freemen; steeling their hearts against the laudable feelings of
    virtue and humanity. And, lastly, as it endangers the community by the
    destructive effects of civil commotions: need I add to these (says that
    author) what every heart, which is not callous to all tender feelings,
    will readily suggest; that it is shocking to humanity, violative of
    every generous sentiment, abhorrent utterly from the <i>Christian</i>
    Religion: for, as <i>Montesquieu</i> very justly observes, <i>We
    must suppose them not to be men, or a suspicion would follow that we
    ourselves are not</i> Christians.——There cannot be a more dangerous
    maxim, than that necessity is a plea for injustice. For who shall fix
    the degree of this necessity? What villain so atrocious, who may not
    urge this excuse? or, as <i>Milton</i> has happily expressed it,
  </p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">‘—————————<i>And with necessity,</i></div>
        <div class="i1"><i>The tyrant’s plea, excuse his dev’lish deed.</i></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>‘That our Colonies want people, is a very weak argument for so
    inhuman a violation of justice.—Shall a civilized, a <i>Christian</i>
    nation encourage Slavery, because the barbarous,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span> savage, lawless
    <i>African</i> hath done it? Monstrous thought! To what end do we
    profess a religion whose dictates we so flagrantly violate? Wherefore
    have we that pattern of goodness and humanity, if we refuse to follow
    it? How long shall we continue a practice, which policy rejects,
    justice condemns, and piety dissuades? Shall the <i>Americans</i>
    persist in a conduct, which cannot be justified; or persevere in
    oppression from which their hearts must recoil? If the barbarous
    <i>Africans</i> shall continue to enslave each other, let the dæmon
    slavery remain among them, that their crime may include its own
    punishment. Let not <i>Christians</i>, by administering to their
    wickedness, confess their religion to be a useless refinement, their
    profession vain, and themselves as inhuman as the savages they detest.’</p>

  <p><i>James Foster</i>, in <i>his Discourses on Natural Religion and
    Social Virtue</i>, also shews his just indignation at this wicked
    practice, which he declares to be <i>a criminal and outrageous
    violation of the natural right of mankind</i>. At page 156, 2d
    vol. he says, ‘Should we have read concerning the <i>Greeks</i> or
    <i>Romans</i> of old, that they traded, with view to make slaves of
    their own species, whom they certainly knew that this would involve
    in schemes of blood and murder, of destroying or enslaving each
    other, that they even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span> fomented wars, and engaged whole nations and
    tribes in open hostilities, for their own private advantage; that
    they had no detestation of the violence and cruelty, but only feared
    the ill success of their inhuman enterprises; that they carried men
    like themselves, their brethren, and the offspring of the same common
    parent, to be sold like beasts of prey, or beasts of burden, and
    put them to the same reproachful trial of their soundness, strength
    and capacity for greater bodily service; that quite forgetting and
    renouncing the original dignity of human nature, communicated to all,
    they treated them with more severity and ruder discipline, than even
    the ox or the ass, who are void of understanding.—Should we not, if
    this had been the case, have naturally been led to despise all their
    pretended refinements of morality; and to have concluded, that as they
    were not nations destitute of politeness, they must have been <i>entire
    Strangers to Virtue and Benevolence</i>?</p>

  <p>‘But, notwithstanding this, we ourselves (who profess to be
    <i>Christians</i>, and boast of the peculiar advantage we enjoy,
    by means of an express revelation of our duty from Heaven) are in
    effect, these very untaught and rude <i>Heathen</i> countries. With
    all our superior light, we instil into those, whom we call savage
    and barbarous, the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span> despicable opinion of human nature. We,
    to the utmost of our power, weaken and dissolve the universal tie,
    that binds and unites mankind. We practise what we should exclaim
    against, as the utmost excess of cruelty and tyranny, if nations of
    the world, differing in colour and form of government from ourselves,
    were so possessed of empire, as to be able to reduce us to a state
    of unmerited and brutish servitude. Of consequence, we sacrifice our
    reason, our humanity, our <i>Christianity</i>, to an unnatural sordid
    gain. We teach other nations to despise and trample under foot, all
    the obligations of social virtue. We take the most effectual method
    to prevent the propagation of the Gospel, by representing it as a
    scheme of power and barbarous oppression, and an enemy to the natural
    privileges and rights of men.</p>

  <p>‘Perhaps all that I have now offered, may be of very little weight to
    restrain this enormity, this aggravated iniquity. However, I shall
    still have the satisfaction, of having entered my private protest
    against a practice which, in my opinion, <i>bids that God, who is the
    God and Father of the</i> Gentiles <i>unconverted to</i> Christianity,
    <i>most daring and bold defiance, and spurns at all the principles both
    of natural and revealed Religion</i>.’</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

  <p>How the <i>British</i> nation first came to be concerned in a
    practice, by which the rights and liberties of mankind are so
    violently infringed, and which is so opposite to the apprehensions
    <i>Englishmen</i> have always had of what natural justice requires,
    is indeed surprising. It was about the year 1563, in the reign of
    Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>, that the <i>English</i> first engaged in the
    <i>Guinea</i> Trade; when it appears, from an account in <i>Hill</i>’s
    Naval History, page 293, That when Captain <i>Hawkins</i> returned from
    his first voyage to <i>Africa</i>, that generous spirited Princess,
    attentive to the interest of her subjects, sent for the Commander, to
    whom she expressed her concern lest any of the <i>African</i> Negroes
    should be carried off without their free consent, <i>declaring it
    would be detestable, and call down the vengeance of Heaven upon the
    undertakers</i>. Captain <i>Hawkins</i> promised to comply with the
    Queen’s injunction: nevertheless, we find in the account, given in the
    same History, of <i>Hawkins</i>’s second voyage, the author using these
    remarkable words, <i>Here began the horrid practice of forcing the</i>
    Africans <i>into slavery</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Labat</i>, a <i>Roman</i> Missionary, in his account of the Isles
    of <i>America</i>, at page 114, of the 4th vol. mentions, that
    <i>Lewis</i> the 13th, Father to the present <i>French</i> King’s
    Grandfather, was extremely uneasy at a Law by which all the Negroes of
    his Colonies were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span> to be made slaves; but it being strongly urged to
    him, as the readiest means for their Conversion to <i>Christianity</i>,
    he acquiesced therewith.</p>

  <p>And although we have not many accounts of the impressions which this
    piratical invasion of the rights of mankind gave to serious minded
    people, when first engaged in; yet it did not escape the notice of
    some, who might be esteemed in a peculiar manner as watchmen in
    their day to the different societies of <i>Christians</i> whereunto
    they belonged. <i>Richard Baxter</i>, an eminent preacher amongst
    the <i>Nonconformists</i>, in the last century, well known and
    particularly esteemed by most of the serious <i>Presbyterians</i>
    and <i>Independents</i>, in his <i>Christian</i> Directory, mostly
    wrote about an hundred Years ago, fully shews his detestation of this
    practice in the following words: ‘Do you not mark how God hath followed
    you with plagues? And may not conscience tell you, that it is for your
    inhumanity to the souls and bodies of men?—To go as pirates and catch
    up poor Negroes, or people of another land, that never forfeited Life
    or Liberty, and to make them Slaves and sell them, is one of the worst
    kind of Thievery in the world; and such persons are to be taken for
    the common Enemies of mankind; and they that buy them, and use them as
    beasts, for their meer commodity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span> and betray, or destroy, or neglect
    their souls, are fitter to be called devils than <i>Christians</i>.
    It is an heinous sin to buy them, unless it be in charity to deliver
    them.——Undoubtedly they are presently bound to deliver them; because by
    right the man is his own; therefore no man else can have a just title
    to him.’</p>

  <p>We also find <i>George Fox</i>, a man of exemplary piety, who was the
    principal instrument in gathering the religious society of people
    called <i>Quakers</i>, expressing his concern and fellow-feeling for
    the bondage of the Negroes: In a discourse taken from his mouth, in
    <i>Barbadoes</i>, in the Year 1671, says, ‘Consider with yourselves, if
    you were in the same condition as the Blacks are,—who came strangers
    to you, and were sold to you as slaves. I say, if this should be the
    condition of you or yours, you would think it hard measure: Yea, and
    very great bondage and cruelty. And, therefore, consider seriously of
    this, and do you for and to them, as you would willingly have them,
    or any other to do unto you, were you in the like slavish condition;
    and bring them to know the Lord Christ.’ And in his journal, page 431,
    speaking of the Advice he gave his friends at <i>Barbadoes</i>, he
    says, ‘I desired also, that they would cause their Overseers to deal
    mildly and gently with their Negroes, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span> not to use cruelty towards
    them, as the manner of some had been; and that after certain years of
    servitude they should make them free.’</p>

  <p>In a book printed in <i>Leverpool</i>, called <i>The Leverpool
    Memorandum-book</i>, which contains, among other things, an account
    of the Trade of that port, there is an exact list of the vessels
    employed in the <i>Guinea</i> Trade, and of the number of Slaves
    imported in each vessel, by which it appears, that in the year 1753,
    the number imported to <i>America</i>, by vessels belonging to that
    port, amounted to upwards of Thirty Thousand; and from the number of
    Vessels employed by the <i>African</i> Company in <i>London</i> and
    <i>Bristol</i>, we may, with some degree of certainty conclude, there
    is, at least, One Hundred Thousand Negroes purchased and brought on
    board our ships yearly from the coast of <i>Africa</i>, on their
    account. This is confirmed in <i>Anderson</i>’s History of Trade
    and Commerce, printed in 1764, where it is said, at page 68 of the
    Appendix, ‘That <i>England</i> supplies her <i>American</i> Colonies
    with Negro-slaves, amounting in number to above One Hundred Thousand
    every year.’ When the vessels are full freighted with slaves, they set
    out for our plantations in <i>America</i>, and may be two or three
    months on the voyage, during which time, from the filth and stench
    that is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span> among them, distempers frequently break out, which carry
    off a great many, a fifth, a fourth, yea, sometimes a third of them;
    so that taking all the slaves together that are brought on board our
    ships yearly, one may reasonably suppose, that at least ten thousand
    of them die on the voyage. And in a printed account of the State of
    the Negroes in our plantations, it is supposed that a fourth part,
    more or less, die at the different Islands, in what is called the
    seasoning. Hence it may be presumed, that, at a moderate computation
    of the slaves, who are purchased by our <i>African</i> merchants in a
    year, near thirty thousand die upon the voyage and in the seasoning.
    Add to this, the prodigious number who are killed in the incursions
    and intestine wars, by which the Negroes procure the number of slaves
    wanted to load the vessels. How dreadful then is this Slave-Trade,
    whereby so many thousands of our fellow-creatures, free by nature,
    endued with the same rational faculties, and called to be heirs of the
    same salvation with us, lose their lives, and are truly, and properly
    speaking, murdered every year! For it is not necessary, in order to
    convict a man of murder, to make it appear, that he had an intention
    to commit murder. Whoever does, by unjust force or violence, deprive
    another of his Liberty; and, while he has him in his power, reduces
    him, by cruel treatment, to such a condition as evidently endangers
    his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span> life, and the event occasions his death, is actually guilty of
    murder. It is no less shocking to read the accounts given by Sir
    <i>Hans Sloane</i>, and others, of the inhuman and unmerciful treatment
    those Blacks meet with, who survive the seasoning in the Islands,
    often for transgressions, to which the punishment they receive bears
    no proportion. ‘And the horrid executions, which are frequently made
    there upon discovery of the plots laid by the Blacks, for the recovery
    of their liberty; of some they break the bones, whilst alive, on a
    wheel; others they burn or rather roast to death; others they starve to
    death, with a loaf hanging before their mouths.’ Thus they are brought
    to expire, with frightful agonies, in the most horrid tortures. For
    negligence only they are unmercifully whipped, till their backs are
    raw, and then pepper and salt is scattered on the wounds to heighten
    the pain, and prevent mortification. Is it not a cause of much sorrow
    and lamentation, that so many poor creatures should be thus racked
    with excruciating tortures, for crimes which often their tormentors
    have occasioned? Must not even the common feelings of human nature
    have suffered some grievous change in those men, to be capable of
    such horrid cruelty towards their fellow-men? If they deserve death,
    ought not their judges, in the death decreed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span> them, always to remember
    that these their hapless fellow-creatures are men, and themselves
    professing <i>Christians</i>? The <i>Mosaic</i> law teaches us our duty
    in these cases, in the merciful provision it made in the punishment of
    transgressors, <i>Deuter.</i> xxv. 2. <i>And it shall be, if the wicked
    man be worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down,
    and to be beaten before his face, according to his fault, by a certain
    number; Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed.</i> And the
    reason rendered is out of respect to human nature, <i>viz. Lest if he
    should exceed, and beat him above these, with many stripes, then thy
    Brother should seem vile unto thee. Britons</i> boast themselves to be
    a generous, humane people, who have a true sense of the importance of
    Liberty; but is this a true character, whilst that barbarous, savage
    Slave-Trade, with all its attendant horrors, receives countenance
    and protection from the Legislature, whereby so many Thousand lives
    are yearly sacrificed? Do we indeed believe the truths declared in
    the Gospel? Are we persuaded that the threatenings, as well as the
    promises therein contained, will have their accomplishment? If indeed
    we do, must we not tremble to think what a load of guilt lies upon our
    Nation generally, and individually so far as we in any degree abet or
    countenance this aggravated iniquity?</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

  <p>We have a memorable Instance in history, which may be fruitful of
    Instruction, if timely and properly applied; it is a quotation made by
    Sir <i>John Temple</i>, in his history of the <i>Irish</i> rebellion,
    being an observation out of <i>Giraldus Cambrensis</i>, a noted author,
    who lived about six hundred years ago, concerning the causes of the
    prosperity of the <i>English</i> undertakings in <i>Ireland</i>, when
    they conquered that Island, he saith, ‘That a synod, or council of the
    Clergy, being then assembled at <i>Armagh</i>, and that point fully
    debated, it was unanimously agreed, that the sins of the people were
    the occasion of that heavy judgment then falling upon their nation;
    and that especially their buying of <i>Englishmen</i> from merchants
    and pirates, and detaining them under a most miserable hard bondage,
    had caused the Lord, by way of just retaliation, to leave them to be
    reduced, by the <i>English</i>, to the same state of slavery. Whereupon
    they made a publick act in that council, that all the <i>English</i>
    held in captivity throughout the whole land, should be presently
    restored to their former Liberty.’</p>

  <p>I shall now conclude with an extract from an address of a late author
    to the merchants, and others, who are concerned in carrying on the
    <i>Guinea</i> Trade; which also, in a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span> measure, is applicable
    to others, who, for the love of gain, are in any way concerned in
    promoting or maintaining the captivity of the Negroes.</p>

  <p>‘As the business, you are publickly carrying on before the world, has
    a bad aspect, and you are sensible most men make objection against
    it, you ought to justify it to the world, upon principles of reason,
    equity, and humanity; to make it appear, that it is no unjust invasion
    of the persons, or encroachments on the rights of men; or for ever to
    lay it aside.—But laying aside the resentment of men, which is but of
    little or no moment, in comparison with that of the Almighty, think
    of a future reckoning: consider how you shall come off in the great
    and awful Day of account. You now heap up riches and live in pleasure;
    but, oh! what will you do in the end thereof? and that is not far off:
    what, if death should seize upon you, and hurry you out of this world,
    under all that load of blood-guiltiness that now lies upon your fouls?
    The gospel expresly declares, that thieves and murderers shall not
    inherit the kingdom of God. Consider, that at the same time, and by
    the same means, you now treasure up worldly riches, you are treasuring
    up to yourselves wrath, against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span> the day of wrath, and vengeance that
    shall come upon the workers of iniquity, unless prevented by a timely
    repentance.</p>

  <p>‘And what greater iniquity, what crime that is more heinous, that
    carries in it more complicated guilt, can you name than that, in the
    habitual, deliberate practice of which you now live? How can you lift
    up your guilty eyes to heaven? How can you pray for mercy to him that
    made you, or hope for any favour from him that formed you, while you go
    on thus grosly and openly to dishonour him, in debasing and destroying
    the noblest workmanship of his hands in this lower world? He is the
    Father of men; and do you think he will not resent such treatment of
    his offspring, whom he hath so loved, as to give his only begotten Son,
    that whosoever believeth in him, might not perish, but have everlasting
    life? This love of God to man, revealed in the gospel, is a great
    aggravation of your guilt; for if God so loved us, we ought also to
    love one another. <i>You remember the fate of the Servant, who took
    hold of his fellow-servant, who was in his debt, by the throat, and
    cast him into prison</i>: Think then, and tremble to think, what will
    be your fate, who take your fellow-servants by the throat, that owe you
    not a penny, and make them prisoners for life.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span></p>

  <p>‘Give yourselves leave to reflect impartially upon, and consider the
    nature of, this Man-Trade, which, if you do, your hearts must needs
    relent, if you have not lost all sense of humanity, all pity and
    companion towards those of your own kind, to think what calamities,
    what havock and destruction among them, you have been the authors of
    for filthy lucre’s sake. God grant you may be sensible of your guilt,
    and repent in time!’</p>
